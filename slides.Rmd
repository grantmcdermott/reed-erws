# Introduction

# Motivation

In the beginning, there were climate blogs.

Instead of arguing, maybe write a paper about it?

---

# Big picture

> How much evidence would it take to convince climate sceptics that they are wrong?

--

### Approach: Bayesian framework
- Combine real climate data with a (plausible) range of stylised sceptics.
- Simple statistical approach rather than a complicated GCM.

--

### Key takeaways

- Available evidence overwhelms all but the most extreme priors.
- However, convergence with the mainstream is non-linear. Gets harder and harder to convince the "marginal" sceptic.

--

I also argue that a generalised Bayesian model provides a bridge between competing theories of climate scepticism.

---

# Background

Comprehensive climate policy remains elusive.
- Many policy makers and citizens remain sceptical, despite overwhelming scientific consensus `r Citep(bib, c('oreskes2004beyond', 'cook2013quantifying', 'cook2016consensus', 'saad2019americans'))`
- Especially true in the US.

Lots of research on the cultural and psychological drivers of climate scepticsm. `r Citep(bib, c('kahan2011cultural', 'kahan2012polarizing', 'hornsey2016meta'))`
- Two main schools of thought: 1) cultural cognition VS 2) information deficit.
- (I'll return to this later.)

--

### This paper

Not so much concerned with the origins of scepticism as its _implications_.
- How much evidence do we need to change the minds of sceptics?
- Sounds like we need some Bayes up in here...

# Beliefs about climate sensitivity

A convenient way to model sceptic beliefs is by defining them in terms of _climate sensitivity_, i.e. the temperature response to a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>.

I focus on **TCR** (transient climate response). According to the IPCC `r Cite(bib, 'ipcc2013i')`: 

--

- TCR is "likely" in the range of 1.0â€“2.5 Â°C.

<b>_tl;dr_</b> Sceptic beliefs can be presented as a distributions of TCR. Any "learning" about the true value of TCR will be constrained by someone's initial beliefs.

# Previous literature

Main differences from previous work stems from a combination of:

--

### 1. Explicit focus on climate sceptics
- Although, I'll also use a "noninformative" prior to construct a reference TCR distribution.
- Related: `r Cite(bib, c('kelly1999learning', 'wijnbergen2015skeptics', 'kiseleva2016heterogeneous'))`, etc.

--

### 2. Use of Bayesian time-series regression
- Much research on the non-stationarity of climate data (ðŸ˜¢), but recent work convincingly argues that these are best described as trend-stationary processes with common structural breaks (ðŸ˜ƒ).
- Related: `r Cite(bib, c('gay2009global', 'estrada2013statistically', 'tol1998bayes'))`, etc.

# Bayesian regression

Estimate probable value of a set of parameters $\theta$, given data $X$:

$$p(\theta|X) = \frac{p(X|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(X)}$$
--

where

- $p(\theta|X)$ is the *posterior*. ("What are the probable values of our parameters, given the data?")
- $p(X|\theta)$ is the *likelihood*. ("How likely are the data given a set of parameters?")
- $p(\theta)$ is the *prior*. ("What do know about the parameters before we see the data?")

--

The final $p(X)$ term in the denominator is the marginal probability of the data. Since this just acts as a normalisation constant (and be calculated *ad hoc*), we typically re-write as...

---

# Bayesian regression (cont.)

Estimate probable value of a set of parameters $\theta$, given data $X$:

$$p(\theta|X) \propto p(X|\theta)p(\theta)$$
</br>
> "The posterior is proportional to the likelihood times the prior"


--

</br>

Looks simple enough, but (with a few exceptions) it is impossible to solve for the posterior analytically. Fortunately, we can [solve algorithmically](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/sceptic-priors) using MCMC software (JAGS, BUGS, Stan, etc.)

--

Let's put these pieces together for the current problem.

---

# Likelihood function

Following `r Cite(bib, c('estrada2012breaks', 'tol1998bayes'))`, I model global temperatures as

$$
  GMST_t = \alpha_0 + \beta_1RF_t + \gamma_2VOLC_t + \delta_3SOI_t + \eta_4AMO_t + \epsilon_t
$$

where

- $GMST$ ~ global mean surface temperature
- $RF$ ~ radiative forcing (CO<sub>2</sub>, solar, etc.)
- $VOLC$ ~ volcanic aerosols
- $SOI$ ~ Southern Oscillation Index (i.e. ENSO)
- $AMO$ ~ Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
- $\epsilon_t = \phi \epsilon_{t-1} + \nu_t$ ~ AR(1) error process

$t$ runs from 1866 to 2005 (historic data) and then up to 2100 (climate scenarios).

---

# Likelihood (cont.)

$$
  GMST_t = \alpha_0 + \beta_1RF_t + \gamma_2VOLC_t + \delta_3SOI_t + \eta_4AMO_t + \epsilon_t
$$

Getting from $\beta$ to TCR is a simple matter of multiplying it by the change in forcing that results from a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>.

$$\text{TCR} = \beta_1 \cdot F_{2\times}$$

where I use the IPCC's best estimate of $F_{2\times}=3.71 \text{ Wm}^{-2}$.

--

</br></br>
**Aside:** Have to combine both anthropogenic and natural forcings in composite $RF$ term, because defined i.t.o of same units (i.e. Wm<sup>-2</sup>). 
- Separating them out risks (a) severe multicollinearity or (b) model becoming unphysical... Although I still do this as a robustness check it has no effect on the main results.

# Priors

Define a typology of four basic sceptics, based on their beliefs about TCR. (A noninformative prior will serve as a reference case.)

# How much evidence would it take?

**Takeaway:** If you aren't convinced by the available data today, you probably won't be convinced for many years hence. (Increasingly hard to convince the marginal sceptic.)

# Bayes as a bridge

In the paper, I return to the _origins_ of climate scepticism.

I argue that a generalised Bayesian framework is able to accommodate competing theories about why climate scepticism exists (persists?) the first place.
- "Cultural cognition" vs "information deficit"

**Key idea:** Incorporate beliefs about source credibility &mdash; e.g. how trustworthy do I find the IPCC? &mdash; that moderates the learning effect of any new information.

# Conclusions

### Research question

How much evidence would it take to convince climate sceptics that they are wrong?

### Framework

Bayesian model combining a range of plausible priors and actual climate data.

### Findings

1. Most subjective priors are overwhelmed by the empirical evidence for climate change.

2. However, convergence with the mainstream is a nonlinear function of prior strength. Increasingly hard to convince the marginal sceptic, so if you aren't persuaded already...

3. Bayes can provide a *lingua franca* between competing theories of climate scepticism as a social phenomenon.
